Securicator is a **decentralized and distributed end-to-end encrypted messaging app**. The features includes delivery and read confirmation, persistence, mulit-device support and the secure chat with the contacts.

This is an experimental project, developed for learning about networking and encryption. If you're considering using this in a production environment (e.g., for sending confidential messages), remember that a thorough security analysis is necessary. To assist you, there's a "Security Checklist" section available in this document.

The first proof of concept of this application was written in Python, and used a different strategy for establishing the connection of two contacts. The deprecated repository can be found at [securicator-v1](https://github.com/pedrorambo/securicator-v1).
